L’implémentation d’un filtre à l’entrée a, en théorie, un double effet sur le mix social des étudiants et son impact sera donc étudié en deux temps. Pour faire le lien entre les deux parties, nous utiliserons l’indice socio-économique (ISE) développé par la Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles (et présenté dans la partie “Facteurs liés à l’origine socio-économique” de la section 1.2.3 sur le filtre naturel) qui nous permet de regrouper les étudiants par quantiles d’ISE et de comparer les taux de diplomation après trois années dans le premier cycle uni- versitaire pour les différents quantiles et en fonction du type de filtre (simple ou double).\n",

Nous réaliserons des analyses bivariées, des statistiques descriptives, une analyse des matières discriminatoires et des taux de réussite pour différents quantiles d’ISE.
