>> Goal 1: No poverty[edit]
SDG 1 is to: "End poverty in all its forms everywhere."[31] Achieving SDG 1 would end extreme poverty globally by 2030. One of its indicators is the proportion of population living below the poverty line.[31] The data gets analyzed by sex, age, employment status, and geographical location (urban/rural).
This section is an excerpt from Sustainable Development Goal 1.[edit]
The goal has seven targets and 13 indicators to measure progress. The five outcome targets are: eradication of extreme poverty; reduction of all poverty by half; implementation of social protection systems; ensuring equal rights to ownership, basic services, technology and economic resources; and the building of resilience to environmental, economic and social disasters. The two targets related to means of implementation[32] SDG 1 are mobilization of resources to end poverty; and the establishment of poverty eradication policy frameworks at all levels.[33][34]

>>Goal 2: Zero hunger (No hunger)[edit]

SDG 2 is to: "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."[35] Indicators for this goal are for example the prevalence of undernourishment, prevalence of severe food insecurity, and prevalence of stunting among children under five years of age.
This section is an excerpt from Sustainable Development Goal 2.[edit]
SDG 2 has eight targets and 14 indicators to measure progress.[36] The five outcome targets are: ending hunger and improving access to food; ending all forms of malnutrition; agricultural productivity; sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices; and genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals; investments, research and technology. The three means of implementation targets[37] include: addressing trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets and food commodity markets and their derivatives.[36][38]

>>Goal 3: Good health and well-being[edit]
SDG 3 is to: "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."[39] Important indicators here are life expectancy as well as child and maternal mortality. Further indicators are for example deaths from road traffic injuries, prevalence of current tobacco use, suicide mortality rate.[39]
This section is an excerpt from Sustainable Development Goal 3.[edit]
SDG 3 has 13 targets and 28 indicators to measure progress toward targets. The first nine targets are outcome targets:

* improving early warning systems for global health risks.[40]
>>Goal 4: Quality education[edit]
SDG 4 is to: "Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all."[41] The indicators for this goal are, for example, attendance rates at primary schools, completion rates of primary school education, participation in tertiary education, and so forth. In each case, parity indices are looked at to ensure that disadvantaged students do not miss out (data is collected on "female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintile and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples") . There is also an indicator around the facilities that the school buildings have (access to electricity, the internet, computers, drinking water, toilets etc.).[41]
This section is an excerpt from Sustainable Development Goal 4.[edit]
SDG 4 has ten targets which are measured by 11 indicators. The seven outcome targets are: free primary and secondary education; equal access to quality pre-primary education; affordable technical, vocational and higher education; increased number of people with relevant skills for financial success; elimination of all discrimination in education; universal literacy and numeracy; and education for sustainable development and global citizenship. The three means of implementation targets[42] are: build and upgrade inclusive and safe schools; expand higher education scholarships for developing countries; and increase the supply of qualified teachers in developing countries.
>>Goal 5: Gender equality[edit]
SDG 5 is to: "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls."[43] Indicators include, for example, having suitable legal frameworks and the representation by women in national parliament or in local deliberative bodies.[15] Numbers on forced marriage and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) are also included in another indicator.[44][15]
This section is an excerpt from Sustainable Development Goal 5.[edit]

* promoting empowerment of women through technology
* adopting and strengthening policies for gender equality, and supporting legislation to enforce it.[46]
>>Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation[edit]
SDG 6 is to: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."[47] The Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of WHO and UNICEF is responsible for monitoring progress to achieve the first two targets of this goal. Important indicators for this goal are the percentages of the population that uses safely managed drinking water, and has access to safely managed sanitation. The JMP reported in 2017 that 4.5 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation.[48] Another indicator looks at the proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater that is safely treated.
This section is an excerpt from Sustainable Development Goal 6.[edit]
The six outcome targets include: Provide safe and affordable drinking water, end open defecation and provide access to sanitation, and hygiene, improve water quality, wastewater treatment and safe reuse, increase water-use efficiency and ensure freshwater supplies, implement IWRM, protect and restore water-related ecosystems. The two means of implementing these targets[49] are to expand water and sanitation support to developing countries, and to support local engagement in water and sanitation management.[50]
>>Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy[edit]
SDG 7 is to "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all."[51] One of the indicators for this goal is the percentage of population with access to electricity (progress in expanding access to electricity has been made in several countries, notably India, Bangladesh, and Kenya[52]). Other indicators look at the renewable energy share and energy efficiency.
This section is an excerpt from Sustainable Development Goal 7.[edit]
The goal has five targets to be achieved by 2030.[53] Progress towards the targets is measured by six indicators.[53] Three out of the five targets are outcome targets: Universal access to modern energy; increase global percentage of renewable energy; double the improvement in energy efficiency. The remaining two targets are means of implementation targets[54]: to promote access to research, technology and investments in clean energy; and expand and upgrade energy services for developing countries. In other words, these targets include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. They also focus on improving energy efficiency, international cooperation and investment in clean energy infrastructure.
>>Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth[edit]
SDG 8 is to: "Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all."[55] Important indicators for this goal include economic growth in least developed countries and the rate of real GDP per capita. Further examples are rates of youth unemployment and occupational injuries or the number of women engaged in the labor force compared to men.[55]
This section is an excerpt from Sustainable Development Goal 8.[edit]
SDG 8 has twelve targets in total to be achieved by 2030. Some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. The first ten are outcome targets. These are; "sustainable economic growth; diversify, innovate and upgrade for economic productivity", "promote policies to support job creation and growing enterprises", "improve resource efficiency in consumption and production", 'full employment and decent work with equal pay', 'promote youth employment, education and training', 'end modern slavery, trafficking, and child labour', 'protect labour rights and promote safe working environments', 'promote beneficial and sustainable tourism', universal access to banking, insurance and financial services. In addition, there are also two targets for means of implementation[56], which are: Increase aid for trade support; develop a global youth employment strategy.
>>Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure[edit]
SDG 9 is to: "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation."[57] Indicators in this goal include for example, the proportion of people who are employed in manufacturing activities, are living in areas covered by a mobile network, or who have access to the internet.[15] An indicator that is connected to climate change is "CO2 emissions per unit of value added."
This section is an excerpt from Sustainable Development Goal 9.[edit]
SDG 9 has eight targets, and progress is measured by twelve indicators. The first five targets are outcome targets: develop sustainable, resilient and inclusive infrastructures; promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization; increase access to financial services and markets; upgrade all industries and infrastructures for sustainability; enhance research and upgrade industrial technologies. The remaining three targets are means of implementation targets[58]: Facilitate sustainable infrastructure development for developing countries; support domestic technology development and industrial diversification; universal access to information and communications technology.
>>Goal 10: Reduced inequality[edit]
SDG 10 is to: "Reduce income inequality within and among countries."[59] Important indicators for this SDG are: income disparities, aspects of gender and disability, as well as policies for migration and mobility of people.[60]
The Goal has ten targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards targets will be measured by indicators. The first seven targets are outcome targets: Reduce income inequalities; promote universal social, economic and political inclusion; ensure equal opportunities and end discrimination; adopt fiscal and social policies that promotes equality; improved regulation of global financial markets and institutions; enhanced representation for developing countries in financial institutions; responsible and well-managed migration policies. The other three targets are means of implementation targets[61]: Special and differential treatment for developing countries; encourage development assistance and investment in least developed countries; reduce transaction costs for migrant remittances.[62]
>>Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities[edit]
SDG 11 is to: "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."[63] Important indicators for this goal are the number of people living in urban slums, the proportion of the urban population who has convenient access to public transport, and the extent of built-up area per person.[15]
SDG 11 has 10 targets to be achieved, and this is being measured with 15 indicators. The seven outcome targets include safe and affordable housing, affordable and sustainable transport systems, inclusive and sustainable urbanization,[64] protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage, reduction of the adverse effects of natural disasters, reduction of the environmental impacts of cities and to provide access to safe and inclusive green and public spaces. The three means of implementation targets[65] include strong national and regional development planning, implementing policies for inclusion, resource efficiency, and disaster risk reduction in supporting the least developed countries in sustainable and resilient building.[66][67]
>>Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production[edit]
SDG 12 is to: "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns."[68] One of the indicators is the number of national policy instruments to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns.[15]: 14  Another one is global fossil fuel subsidies.[15]: 14  An increase in domestic recycling and a reduced reliance on the global plastic waste trade are other actions that might help meet the goal.[69]
Sustainable Development Goal 12 has 11 targets. The first 8 are outcome targets, which are: implement the 10-Year Framework of Programs on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns; achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources; reducing by half the per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and the reduction of food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses; achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle; reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse; encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices; promote public procurement practices that are sustainable; and ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development. The three means of implementation targets[70] are: support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity; develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts; and remove market distortions, like fossil fuel subsidies, that encourage wasteful consumption.[71]
>>Goal 13: Climate action[edit]
SDG 13 is to: "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts by regulating emissions and promoting developments in renewable energy."[72] In 2021 to early 2023, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its Sixth Assessment Report which assesses scientific, technical, and socio-economic information concerning climate change.[73]
SDG 13 has five targets which are to be achieved by 2030. They cover a wide range of issues surrounding climate action. The first three targets are outcome targets: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters; integrate climate change measures into policies and planning; build knowledge and capacity to meet climate change. The remaining two targets are means of implementation targets[74]: To implement the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and to promote mechanisms to raise capacity for planning and management. Along with each target, there are indicators that provide a method to review the overall progress of each target. The UNFCCC is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.
>>Goal 14: Life below water[edit]
SDG 14 is to: "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development."[75] The current efforts to protect oceans, marine environments and small-scale fishers are not meeting the need to protect the resources.[15] Increased ocean temperatures and oxygen loss act concurrently with ocean acidification to constitute the deadly trio of climate change pressures on the marine environment.[76]
The first seven targets are outcome targets: Reduce marine pollution; protect and restore ecosystems; reduce ocean acidification; sustainable fishing; conserve coastal and marine areas; end subsidies contributing to overfishing; increase the economic benefits from sustainable use of marine resources. The last three targets are means of implementation targets[77]: To increase scientific knowledge, research and technology for ocean health; support small scale fishers; implement and enforce international sea law.[78] One indicator (14.1.1b) under Goal 14 specifically relates to reducing impacts from marine plastic pollution.[79]
>>Goal 15: Life on land[edit]
SDG 15 is to: "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."[80] The proportion of remaining forest area, desertification and species extinction risk are example indicators of this goal.[15][81]
The nine outcome targets include: Conserve and restore terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; end deforestation and restore degraded forests; end desertification and restore degraded land; ensure conservation of mountain ecosystems, protect biodiversity and natural habitats; protect access to genetic resources and fair sharing of the benefits; eliminate poaching and trafficking of protected species; prevent invasive alien species on land and in water ecosystems; and integrate ecosystem and biodiversity in governmental planning. The three means of implementation targets[82] include: Increase financial resources to conserve and sustainably use ecosystem and biodiversity; finance and incentivize sustainable forest management; combat global poaching and trafficking.
>>Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions[edit]
SDG 16 is to: "Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."[83] Rates of birth registration and prevalence of bribery are two examples of indicators included in this goal.[84][15]
SDG 16 has ten outcome targets: Reduce violence; protect children from abuse, exploitation, trafficking and violence; promote the rule of law and ensure equal access to justice; combat organized crime and illicit financial and arms flows, substantially reduce corruption and bribery; develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions; ensure responsive, inclusive and representative decision-making; strengthen the participation in global governance; provide universal legal identity; ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms. There are also two means of implementation targets[85]: Strengthen national institutions to prevent violence and combat crime and terrorism; promote and enforce non-discriminatory laws and policies.[86]
>>Goal 17: Partnership for the goals[edit]
SDG 17 is to: "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development."[87] Increasing international cooperation is seen as vital to achieving each of the 16 previous goals.[88] Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships to facilitate knowledge exchange, expertise, technology, and financial resources is recognized as critical to overall success of the SDGs. The goal includes improving north-south and South-South cooperation. Public-private partnerships which involve civil societies are specifically mentioned.[89][90]
SDG 17 is a vision for improved and more equitable trade, as well as coordinated investment initiatives to promote sustainable development across borders. It is about strengthening and streamlining cooperation between nation-states, both developed and developing, using the SDGs as a shared framework and a shared vision for defining that collaborative way forward.[91] It seeks to promote international trade and an equitable trading system.[92] The Goal has 17 targets to be achieved by 2030, broken down into five categories: finance, technology, capacity building, trade and systemic issues. Progress towards targets will be measured by 25 indicators.[91][93] All these targets are regarded as means of implementation targets.[94]
