in peer‐to‐peer lending, it is important to predict the repayment of the borrower to
reduce the lender's financial loss. however, it is difficult to design a powerful feature
extractor for predicting the repayment as user and transaction data continue to
increase. convolutional neural networks automatically extract useful features from
big data, but they use only high‐level features; hence, it is difficult to capture a variety
of representations. in this study, we propose a deep dense convolutional network for
repayment prediction in social lending, which maintains the borrower's semantic
information and obtains a good representation by automatically extracting important
low‐ and high‐level features simultaneously. we predict the repayment of the bor-
rower by learning discriminative features depending on the loan status. experimental
results on the lending club dataset show that our model is more effective than other
methods. a fivefold cross‐validation is performed to run the experiments.
