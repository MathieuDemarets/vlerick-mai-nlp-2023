—in 2008, the us experienced the worst financial
crisis succeeding the great depression of the 1930s. a recession
fueled by an influx of poorly underwritten mortgages, in which
a high percentage of ”less credit-worthy” borrowers defaulted
on their mortgage payments. to date, the market has recovered
from the collapse but we must avoid the pitfalls of the previous
market meltdown. greed and over zealous assumptions fueled
the 2008 crisis and it is imperative that bank underwriters
properly assess risks with the assistance of newer technologies.
in this paper we utilize machine learning techniques to predict
the approval or denial of a mortgage applicant. the mortgage
decision will be determined by a two-tier machine learning model
that examines micro and macro risk exposures. we performed
comparative analysis using logistic regression, random forest,
adaboost optimizer, and deep neural network. logistic regression
provided optimal results and thus the decision model. our model
currently tests at an accuracy level of 85.85% and f1 score of
0.87 using logistic regression. this technology will offer a unique
perspective and add value to banking risk models.
