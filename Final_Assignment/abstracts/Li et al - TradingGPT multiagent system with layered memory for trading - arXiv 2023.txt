large language models (llms), prominently highlighted by the recent evolution in the generative
pre-trained transformers (gpt) series, have displayed significant prowess across various domains,
such as aiding in healthcare diagnostics and curating analytical business reports. the efficacy of
gpts lies in their ability to decode human instructions, achieved through comprehensively processing
historical inputs as an entirety within their memory system. yet, the memory processing of gpts
does not precisely emulate the hierarchical nature of human memory, which is categorized into long,
medium, and short-term layers. this can result in llms struggling to prioritize immediate and
critical tasks efficiently. to bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative llm multi-agent framework
endowed with layered memories. we assert that this framework is well-suited for stock and fund
trading, where the extraction of highly relevant insights from hierarchical financial data is imperative
to inform trading decisions. within this framework, one agent organizes memory into three distinct
layers, each governed by a custom decay mechanism, aligning more closely with human cognitive
processes. agents can also engage in inter-agent communication and debate. in financial trading
contexts, llms serve as the decision core for trading agents, leveraging their layered memory system
to integrate multi-source historical actions and market insights. this equips them to navigate financial
changes, formulate strategies, and debate with peer agents about investment decisions. another
standout feature of our approach is to enable agents with individualized trading characters, which
enrich the diversity of their highlighted essential memories and improve decision-making robustness.
by leveraging agentsâ€™ layered memory processing and consistent information interchange, the entire
trading system demonstrates augmented adaptability to historical trades and real-time market cues.
this synergistic approach guarantees premier automated trading with heightened execution accuracy.
