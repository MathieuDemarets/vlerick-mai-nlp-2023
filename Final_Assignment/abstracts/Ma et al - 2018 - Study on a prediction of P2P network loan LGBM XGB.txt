big data and the internet financial sector tremendously developed in the 21st century. the national emphasis on
this field has also gradually improved. peer-to-peer (p2p) is an innovative mode of borrowing that is a powerful
complement to the traditional financial industry. the projected default rate on credit is an absolute prerequisite
for guaranteeing the proper operation of related financial projects or platforms. in this paper, we use ‘multi-
observation’ and ‘multi-dimensional’ data cleaning method and apply the modern machine learning algorithms
lightgbm in asia at the end of 2016 and xgboost, which are based on real p2p transaction data from lending
club. the default risk of loans in the platform is strongly and innovatively predicted. and the results of different
methods are compared. furthermore, we observe that the lightgbm algorithm based on multiple observational
data set classification prediction results is the best. the average performance rate of the historical transaction
data of the lending club platform rose by 1.28 percentage points, which reduced loan defaults by approximately
$117 million. finally, with respect to the influencing factors of the default rate, suggested developments for the
lending club and other p2p platforms are provided as is the suggested direction of other countries’ development
in this field.
