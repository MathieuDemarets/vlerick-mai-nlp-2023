interpretml is an open-source python package which exposes machine learning inter-
pretability algorithms to practitioners and researchers. interpretml exposes two types of
interpretability â€“ glassbox, which are machine learning models designed for interpretabil-
ity (ex: linear models, rule lists, generalized additive models), and blackbox explainability
techniques for explaining existing systems (ex: partial dependence, lime). the package
enables practitioners to easily compare interpretability algorithms by exposing multiple
methods under a unified api, and by having a built-in, extensible visualization platform.
interpretml also includes the first implementation of the explainable boosting machine, a
powerful, interpretable, glassbox model that can be as accurate as many blackbox models.
the mit licensed source code can be downloaded from github.com/microsoft/interpret.
