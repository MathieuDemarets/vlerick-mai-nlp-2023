the past decade has witnessed a rapid growth of research on fair-
ness in machine learning. in contrast, fairness has been formally
studied for almost a century in microeconomics in the context of
resource allocation, during which many general-purpose notions
of fairness have been proposed. this paper explore the applicability
of two such notions — envy-freeness and equitability — in machine
learning. we propose novel relaxations of these fairness notions
which apply to groups rather than individuals, and are compelling
in a broad range of settings. our approach provides a unifying
framework by incorporating several recently proposed fairness
definitions as special cases. we provide generalization bounds for
our approach, and theoretically and experimentally evaluate the
tradeoff between loss minimization and our fairness guarantees.
