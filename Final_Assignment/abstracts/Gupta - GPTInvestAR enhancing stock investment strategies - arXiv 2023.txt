annual reports of publicly listed companies contain vital information about
their financial health which can help assess the potential impact on stock price
of the firm. these reports are comprehensive in nature, going up to, and some-
times exceeding, 100 pages. analysing these reports is cumbersome even for a
single firm, let alone the whole universe of firms that exist. over the years, finan-
cial experts have become proficient in extracting valuable information from these
documents relatively quickly. however, this requires years of practice and experi-
ence. this paper aims to simplify the process of assessing annual reports of all
the firms by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (llms). the
insights generated by the llm are compiled in a quant styled dataset and aug-
mented by historical stock price data. a machine learning model is then trained
with llm outputs as features. the walkforward test results show promising out-
performance wrt s&p500 returns. this paper intends to provide a framework for
future work in this direction. to facilitate this, the code has been released as
open source∗.
