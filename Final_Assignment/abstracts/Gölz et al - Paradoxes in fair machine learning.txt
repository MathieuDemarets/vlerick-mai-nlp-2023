equalized odds is a statistical notion of fairness in machine learning that ensures
that classification algorithms do not discriminate against protected groups. we
extend equalized odds to the setting of cardinality-constrained fair classification,
where we have a bounded amount of a resource to distribute. this setting coincides
with classic fair division problems, which allows us to apply concepts from that
literature in parallel to equalized odds. in particular, we consider the axioms
of resource monotonicity, consistency, and population monotonicity, all three of
which relate different allocation instances to prevent paradoxes. using a geometric
characterization of equalized odds, we examine the compatibility of equalized odds
with these axioms. we empirically evaluate the cost of allocation rules that satisfy
both equalized odds and axioms of fair division on a dataset of fico credit scores.
