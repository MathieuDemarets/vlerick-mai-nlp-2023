this study examines whether the evaluation of a bankruptcy prediction model
should take into account the total cost of misclassification. for this purpose, we
introduce and apply a validity measure in credit scoring that is based on the
total cost of misclassification. specifically, we use comprehensive data from
the annual financial statements of a sample of german companies and analyze
the total cost of misclassification by comparing a generalized linear model and
a generalized additive model with regard to their ability to predict a company's
probability of default. on the basis of these data, the validity measure we intro-
duce shows that, compared to generalized linear models, generalized additive
models can reduce substantially the extent of misclassification and the total
cost that this entails. the validity measure we introduce is informative and
justifies the argument that generalized additive models should be preferred,
although such models are more complex than generalized linear models. we
conclude that to balance a model's validity and complexity, it is necessary to
take into account the total cost of misclassification.
