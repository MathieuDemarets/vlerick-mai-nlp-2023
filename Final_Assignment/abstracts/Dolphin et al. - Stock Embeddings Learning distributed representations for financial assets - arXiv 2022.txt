—identifying meaningful relationships between the
price movements of financial assets is a challenging but important
problem in a variety of financial applications. however with
recent research, particularly those using machine learning and
deep learning techniques, focused mostly on price forecasting,
the literature investigating the modelling of asset correlations has
lagged somewhat. to address this, inspired by recent successes
in natural language processing, we propose a neural model for
training stock embeddings, which harnesses the dynamics of
historical returns data in order to learn the nuanced relationships
that exist between financial assets. we describe our approach in
detail and discuss a number of ways that it can be used in
the financial domain. furthermore, we present the evaluation
results to demonstrate the utility of this approach, compared
to several important benchmarks, in two real-world financial
analytics tasks.
