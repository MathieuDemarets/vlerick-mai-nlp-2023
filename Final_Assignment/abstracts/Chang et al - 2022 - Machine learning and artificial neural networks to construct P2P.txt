: in this study, we constructed the credit-scoring model of p2p loans by using several 
machine learning and artificial neural network (ann) methods, including logistic regression (lr), 
a support vector machine, a decision tree, random forest, xgboost, lightgbm and 2-layer neural 
networks. this study explores several hyperparameter settings for each method by performing a grid 
search and cross-validation to get the most suitable credit-scoring model in terms of training time 
and test performance. in this study, we get and clean the open p2p loan data from lending club with 
feature engineering concepts. in order to find significant default factors, we used an xgboost 
method to pre-train all data and get the feature importance. the 16 selected features can provide 
economic implications for research about default prediction in p2p loans. besides, the empirical 
result shows that gradient-boosting decision tree methods, including xgboost and lightgbm, 
outperform ann and lr methods, which are commonly used for traditional credit scoring. among 
all of the methods, xgboost performed the best.
