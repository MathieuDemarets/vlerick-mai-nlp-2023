this paper presents a multilayer and parallel-connected graph convolu-
tional networks (mpgcns) method to explore whether a debtor–creditor 
relationship network helps to detect the default risk in peer-to-peer (p2p) 
lending. results show that: (1) the debtor–creditor relationship network 
reflects lenders’ risk preference and borrowers’ successful loan information. 
(2) the proposed mpgcns method can detect default risk accurately. 
therefore, considering the structure of the debtor–creditor relationship 
network is helpful for p2p lending regulators and government supervisors 
to control risk.
