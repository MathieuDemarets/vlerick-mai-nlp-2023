: airtime lending default rates are typically lower than those experienced by banks and
microfinance institutions (mfis) but are likely to grow as the service is offered more widely. in this
paper, credit scoring techniques are reviewed, and that knowledge is built upon to create an
appropriate machine learning model for airtime lending. over three million loans belonging to
more than 41 thousand customers with a repayment period of three months are analysed. logistic
regression, decision trees and random forest are evaluated for their ability to classify defaulters
using several cross-validation approaches and the latter model performed best. when the default
rate is below 2%, it is better to offer everyone a loan. for higher default rates, the model substantially
enhances profitability. the model quadruples the tolerable level of default rate for breaking even from
8% to 32%. nonlinear classification models offer considerable potential for credit scoring, coping
with higher levels of default and therefore allowing for larger volumes of customers.
