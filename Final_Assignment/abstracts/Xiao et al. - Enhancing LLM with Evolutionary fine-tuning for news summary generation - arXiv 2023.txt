 
news 
summary 
generation 
is 
an 
important task in the field of intelligence 
analysis, which can provide accurate and 
comprehensive information to 
help 
people better understand and respond to 
complex real-world events. however, 
traditional news summary generation 
methods face some challenges, which are 
limited by the model itself and the 
amount of training data, as well as the 
influence of text noise, making it difficult 
to 
generate 
reliable 
information 
accurately. in this paper, we propose a 
new paradigm for news summary 
generation using llm with powerful 
natural language understanding and 
generative capabilities. we use llm to 
extract multiple structured event patterns 
from the events contained in news 
paragraphs, evolve the event pattern 
population with genetic algorithm, and 
select the most adaptive event pattern to 
input into the llm to generate news 
summaries. a news summary generator 
(nsg) is designed to select and evolve 
the event pattern populations and 
generate 
news 
summaries. 
the 
experimental results show that the news 
summary generator is able to generate 
accurate and reliable news summaries 
with some generalization ability.
