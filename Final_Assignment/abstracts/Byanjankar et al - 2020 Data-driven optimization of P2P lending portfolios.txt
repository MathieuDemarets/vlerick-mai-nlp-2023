in recent years, peer-to-peer (p2p) lending has been gaining popularity amongst bor-
rowers and individual investors. this can mainly be attributed to the easy and quick
access to loans and the higher possible returns. however, the risk involved in these
investments is considerable, and for most investors, being nonprofessionals, this
increases the complexity and the importance of investment decisions. in this study,
we focus on generating optimal investment decisions to lenders for selecting loans.
we treat the loan selection process in p2p lending as a portfolio optimization prob-
lem, with the aim being to select a set of loans that provide a required return while
minimizing risk. in the process, we use internal rate of return as the measure of
return. as the starting point of the model, we use machine-learning algorithms to pre-
dict the default probabilities and calculate expected values for the loans based on his-
torical data. afterwards, we calculate the distance between loans using (i) default
probabilities and, as a novel step, (ii) expected value. in the calculations, we utilize
kernel functions to obtain similarity weights of loans as the input of the optimization
models. two optimization models are tested and compared on data from the popular
p2p platform lending club. the results show that using the expected-value frame-
work yields higher return.
