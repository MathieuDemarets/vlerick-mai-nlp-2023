climate-related risks have become a major concern for financial regulators and can pose a significant threat to
financial stability. in this paper, we first propose a theoretical framework for the transmission of climate risks
to financial institutions and the financial system. we then estimate the influence of physical and transition
risks on the european financial system through bank-level and system-wide measures of financial stability. we
find that scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, chronic and acute climate risks negatively affect financial stability
at both the financial institution and system levels. temperature anomalies, heat waves, wildfires and droughts
are among the most significant risks. as europe warms twice as fast as the rest of the world, our theoretical
and empirical results urge regulators to mandatorily require the assessment and disclosure of corporate climate
risks to allow banks to adjust their prudential capital requirements.
