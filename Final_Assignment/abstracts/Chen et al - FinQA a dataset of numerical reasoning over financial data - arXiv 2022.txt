the sheer volume of financial statements
makes it difficult for humans to access and an-
alyze a business’s financials. robust numeri-
cal reasoning likewise faces unique challenges
in this domain.
in this work, we focus on
answering deep questions over financial data,
aiming to automate the analysis of a large cor-
pus of financial documents. in contrast to ex-
isting tasks on general domain, the finance do-
main includes complex numerical reasoning
and understanding of heterogeneous represen-
tations. to facilitate analytical progress, we
propose a new large-scale dataset, finqa,
with question-answering pairs over financial
reports, written by financial experts. we also
annotate the gold reasoning programs to en-
sure full explainability. we further introduce
baselines and conduct comprehensive experi-
ments in our dataset. the results demonstrate
that popular, large, pre-trained models fall far
short of expert humans in acquiring finance
knowledge and in complex multi-step numer-
ical reasoning on that knowledge. our dataset
— the first of its kind — should therefore en-
able significant, new community research into
complex application domains. the dataset and
code are publicly available1.
