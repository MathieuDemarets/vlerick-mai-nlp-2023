—machine learning models and artificial intelligence
algorithms are required to provide powerful predictions to
support the decision process of operators in the fintech sector,
characterised by an extensive use of credit scoring models
and digitalised financial services. in such a context, the model
predictive accuracy assessment represents a basic requirement.
on the one hand, literature provides several predictive accuracy
measures but, on the other hand, these measures are typically
computationally intensive or are based on subjective criteria.
in this paper a solution is provided through a novel predictive
accuracy measure, we called rank graduation accuracy (rga),
which is based on the distance between the predicted and
observed ranks of the response variable. the rga presents
properties which allow to fulfill the need of ensuring reliable
predictions improving the model predictive accuracy assessment
in highly complex situations.
