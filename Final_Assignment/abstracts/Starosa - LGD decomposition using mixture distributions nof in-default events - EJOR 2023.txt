 
modeling loss in the case of default is a crucial task for financial institutions to support the decision 
making process in the risk management framework. it has become an inevitable part of modern debt 
collection strategies to keep promising loans on the banking book and to write off those that are not 
expected to be recovered at a satisfactory level. research tends to model loss given default directly or 
to decompose it based on the dependent variable distribution. such an approach neglects the patterns 
which exist beneath the recovery process and are mainly driven by the activities made by collectors 
in the event of default. to overcome this problem, we propose a decomposition of the lgd model that 
integrates cures, partial recoveries, and write-offs into one equation, defined based on common collection 
strategies. furthermore, various levels of data aggregation are applied to each component to reflect the 
domain that influences each stage of the default process. to assess the robustness of our approach, we 
propose a comparison with two benchmark models on two different datasets. we assess the goodness of 
fit on out-of-sample data and show that the proposed decomposition is more effective than state-of-the- 
art methods, maintaining a strong level of interpretability.
