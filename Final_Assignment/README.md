# Reacfin Knowledge Base

This is the repository that has been used to develop the demo for the final assignment of the course "Natural Language Processing" at the Vlerick Business School.

All the code (exploration, validation, and development) can be found in the `Articles.ipynb` notebook. The Streamlit app that was used to do the demo can be found found in the `app.py` file and ran with the `app.bat` file (the paths have to be adapted to your local machine).

The other folders have been created from the `Articles.ipynb` with a zip containing all the articles as unique output. Their meaning is therefore easy to understand after reading the notebook.

Hope you enjoy the reading.
